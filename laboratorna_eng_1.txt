The history of the calendar is not only material for illustrating the development of the science of time measurement. The features of the calendar 
sometimes help to understand the past, and the introduction of a new calendar is often accompanied by important political events. Such examples are 
also known from the history of our country. Let us dwell on one of them. ...988. Christianity was adopted as the state religion in Rus. Despite the 
importance of this event, the chronicles limit themselves to describing the baptism of the people of Kyiv, without mentioning the day, month, or 
even the season when it took place. Why? Numerous facts indicate that the adoption of Christianity in Rus was not a surprise. According to Arab and 
Byzantine sources, there were already many Christians among the Rus warriors and merchants in the 9th century. Prince Vladimir's grandmother Olga 
and some of her close relatives were known to be Christians. In the first half of the 10th century, there was already a Christian church in Kyiv — 
the Church of St. Elias. The Tale of Bygone Years also describes how the adoption of the new religion was prepared. A council of boyars and city 
elders, convened by Prince Vladimir in 987, decided to send envoys to various countries to ascertain the advantages of one form of religion or 
another. Upon returning home, the envoys spoke in favor of adopting Christianity based on the Greek model. A new meeting of the boyars, which took 
place in the same year, approved this decision and instructed the prince to choose a place for the baptism of the people of Kyiv. The date of this 
important event was not discussed at the meeting (as if it were something that had long been known). Why? An important aspect of the adoption of 
Christianity in Rus was the introduction of the Christian Julian calendar, a local feature of which was the designation of New Year's Day as March 
1 according to the Julian style (hereinafter referred to as J.C.). Why was this day the first day of the year? Perhaps March 1 (J.C.) 988 was chosen 
by the prince because this day was considered in Christianity to be the day of the creation of the universe? However, although the church Easter 
year began on March 1, the beginning of the civil year in Catholic countries was January 1, and in Orthodox Byzantium — September 1. So, maybe the 
reason why the beginning of the year in Rus' was set for March was that, when introducing the new calendar, the prince wanted to start it right after 
the end of the old pre-Christian calendar year?

Mercury is the least studied terrestrial planet. Previously, only one spacecraft, the American Mariner 10, approached the planet in 1974 and 1975. 
It transmitted data collected during three short-term flybys covering only part (45%) of Mercury's surface. The new spacecraft launched to study 
Mercury is Messenger (Messenger — Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging). . The Messenger project will cost US$256 million, 
making it one of NASA's cheapest space missions. With the help of this spacecraft, scientists intend to obtain photographs of the entire surface of 
the planet and learn more about its structure and formation principles. The new space explorer will arrive at Mercury in January 2008. In addition 
to these two American missions, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) are developing the VerriColombo 
mission. The VerriColombo spacecraft is scheduled to launch in 2013 and will reach Mercury's orbit in 2019, where it will split into two components. 
Let's take a closer look at the above-mentioned space missions to Mercury and the scientific results that have already been obtained with their help, 
as well as those that are planned. Mariner-10 is an automatic interplanetary station launched on November 3, 1973, by an Atlas/Centaur (Atlas SLV-3D/ 
Centaur D-1A) from Cape Canaveral. The mission's objective was to study the planets Venus and Mercury from a flyby trajectory. The total cost of the 
project was approximately $100 million. Mariner 10 remains the only spacecraft to have studied and photographed Mercury from close range. It was the 
last spacecraft in the Mariner series, as Mariner 11 and Mariner 12 were later renamed Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, respectively. The spacecraft's 
specifications: a 1.4 m long body and two solar panels, each 2.7 m long; launch mass — 503 kg, of which 79.4 kg was scientific equipment. The 
spacecraft was equipped with two identical cameras for operation in the visible and ultraviolet ranges; an infrared radiometer; an ultraviolet 
spectrograph; a solar plasma detector; a set of Geiger-Müller counters for registering charged particles; and two magnetometers mounted on a 7 m 
long rod. The Mariner 10 spacecraft was the first to use a gravitational maneuver and change its perihelion with the help of Venus to approach 
Mercury's orbit. The distance to Venus was 5,770 km. The spacecraft transmitted approximately 3,000 images of the planet in ultraviolet and visible 
light with a maximum resolution of 90 and 18 m, respectively. The photographs showed that the planet's atmosphere is in constant motion, and based 
on their data, a model of the dynamics of the Venusian atmosphere was created. The spacecraft also refined the mass of Venus (it turned out to be 
slightly less than previously used in calculations) and confirmed the absence of a magnetic field.

One woman had a little daughter named Olya. When the girl turned five, she fell seriously ill: she became weak, began to cough, and wasted away 
before our eyes. Relatives began to visit the unfortunate mother: Olya's aunts, uncles, grandmothers, and grandfathers. Each brought something tasty 
and nutritious: linden honey and sweet cow butter, fresh forest berries and nuts, quail eggs, and chicken wing broth. Everyone said, “You need to eat
well, breathe fresh air, and the disease will flee to the forests and swamps.” Olya ate honeycomb and sweet cow butter, forest berries and nuts, 
quail eggs and chicken wing broth. But nothing helped—the girl could barely get out of bed. One day, her relatives gathered around the sick girl. 
Grandfather Opanas said: “Something is missing. But I can't figure out what it is.” Suddenly, the door opened, and Olia's great-grandmother, 
100-year-old Nadiya, entered the room. Her relatives had forgotten about her because she had been sitting in her house for many years, never going 
anywhere. But when she heard about her great-granddaughter's illness, she decided to visit her. She approached the bed, sat down on a stool, took 
Olia's small, wrinkled hand in hers, and said: "I have no honeycombs, no sweet cow butter, no fresh forest berries, no nuts, no quail eggs, no 
chicken wings. I have grown old and cannot see anything. I have brought you, my dear great-granddaughter, one single gift: a heartfelt wish. The 
only wish left in my heart is for you, my little flower, to get well and rejoice in the bright sunshine again. There was such tremendous power of 
love in these kind words that little Olya's heart began to beat faster, her cheeks turned pink, and her eyes lit up with joy. “That's what Olya was 
missing,” said Grandpa Opanas. “Kind words.”

School uniforms did not appear yesterday. Their roots date back to the 19th century, when civil uniforms for gymnasiums were approved in the Russian 
Empire in 1833. Boys wore frock coats, and girls wore dresses of certain colors depending on their age, for example, brown for younger students and 
white for older students. It was not just clothing, but a status symbol that reflected the hierarchy of society. After the October Revolution of 
1918, uniforms were abolished, as they were considered a symbol of “bourgeois oppression.” But after World War II, they returned to the USSR to 
emphasize unity and discipline. In Ukraine, decrees regulating school uniforms were in force until 1996, but after a presidential decree in 2019, 
their mandatory nature was abolished, leaving the decision to the discretion of schools. Today, uniforms are not a unified standard but a field for 
experimentation: from embroidered shirts to modern suits with school logos. But are they necessary in the 21st century? Let's take a closer look. 
Proponents of uniforms are convinced that they are more than just clothing. They create an atmosphere, set the tone, and influence student behavior. 
Here are the key arguments that are most often heard in discussions. Discipline and order. Uniforms create a working atmosphere, similar to a 
business dress code in an office. Students dressed in the same style are less distracted by their appearance and focus on their studies. Social 
equality. Uniforms level the playing field in terms of wealth: children from poorer families do not feel uncomfortable next to those wearing designer 
clothes. Saving time and money. Parents do not have to think about what to dress their children in every day.

A telephone is a device for transmitting and receiving sound (mainly human speech) over a distance. Modern telephones transmit using electrical 
signals and radio signals. It is one of the most widespread and indispensable means of communication in the modern world. The term “telephone” is 
also used as a commonly accepted abbreviation for telephony, telephone device, and network subscriber number. The history of the telephone began in 
the United States at the end of the 19th century. In 1876, American inventor Alexander Graham Bell received a patent for his invention—the telephone. 
He was the first to successfully develop a device capable of transmitting and receiving sound signals over a wire line. Bell became the founder of 
the Bell Telephone Company, which later became part of AT&T, one of the largest telephone operators in the United States. It is also believed that, 
independently of Bell, the telephone was invented by Elisha Gray, but Bell's patent application was recognized as the first. In 1878, the first 
telephone was installed in Boston, Massachusetts. Since then, the telephone network has begun to develop actively, and by the beginning of the 20th 
century, it covered most of North America. In 1891, AT&T proposed the creation of the first international telephone line connecting the United States 
and Canada. In the 1920s, telephones began to be mass-produced and used in Europe. One of the key players in this market was the Swedish company 
Ericsson, which is still one of the world's leading telephone manufacturers. In 1927, the first telephone line between Europe and North America was 
established, significantly improving international communication capabilities. With the development of technology and the emergence of new inventions, 
telephones became increasingly sophisticated. In 1947, Bell Laboratories introduced the first transistor telephone, a device that used transistors 
instead of tubes to amplify the signal. This made phones more compact and reliable. In 1973, Motorola introduced the first mobile phone. It was 
large and heavy, but it ushered in a new era of mobile communications.
